# Weather by Reference Point

This is a weather app inspired by [an xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/526/) comic about the difficulties of using the metric system when you're not used to it. They suggest that the reason why it is difficult is because we don't have mental references to use for different measurements. When we think "72 degrees Fahrenheit" we aren't using some kind of mathematical formula to understand what they feels like. We just interpret that as "room temperature." When we think "32 degrees celsius" we interpret that as "the freezing point of water." If we could think "water's freezing point" when we hear "0 degrees Celsius" instead of trying to convert it to Fahrenheit, then it would make life easier. This app displays the temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius along with a message you can use to get a feel for that temperature. 

The messages were taken from a survey that I posted on Reddit's [r/SampleSize](http://www.reddit.com/r/samplesize) community back in 2016. This app was originally written using jQuery as part of FreeCodeCamp's Frontend Developer Certificate program. This version of the app is a rewrite that I did using Vue.js.
